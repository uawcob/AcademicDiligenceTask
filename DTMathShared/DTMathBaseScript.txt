Instruct2	Content	Good job! You have completed the practice and are ready to move onto the main activity.	
Instruct3	Content	What am I going to be doing? NEWLINEIn the next section you will solve math problems just like the practice. Treat the problems as if they were an exam. Try to solve as many problems as quickly and accurately as possible.	-1
Instruct4	Content	What else can you do during this activity?NEWLINEWhenever you feel like it, you can take a break by clicking "play games" on the right side of the screen to play games.	-1
ManipCheck03	Question	Why are you going to do the math problems?:The researcher told me to:Practicing simple math can improve my problem solving skills:I do not know	-1
Instruct5	Content	You are about to begin the activity! Remember, you will be able to play games whenever you feel like it, but the more problems you do, the better you will become at problem solving. To play games, click "play games" on the right side of the screen. To switch back to math, click "do work" on the left side of the screen. NEWLINEAt the end of the task, we will tell you how many problems you got correct.NEWLINEClick "next" when you are ready to start.	-1
